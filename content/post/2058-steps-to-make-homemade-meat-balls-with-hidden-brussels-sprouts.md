recipeingredient:
- " Meatballs"
- "10 Brussels sprouts"
- "250 grams Ground meat for making sausages"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "1 clove Garlic"
- "50 ml White wine"
- "1/4 Red bell pepper"
- "1/2 bunch Fresh parsley"
- "2 tbsp Panko"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Milk"
- "1/2 Egg"
- " Sauce"
- "200 ml Tomato sauce"
- "200 ml White wine"
- "200 ml Water"
- "1 Soup stock cube"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut a cross-shaped notch into the bottoms of the Brussels sprouts, and boil. I keep boiled ingredients in the freezer, so I used defrosted ones this time."
- "Finely chop the onion. Smash the garlic and remove the sprouting part inside. Heat olive oil in a frying pan, and sauté the onions over medium heat. Add garlic once the onions have become transparent. Add 50 ml of white wine, cover with a lid, and simmer to reduce. Let cool once the moisture has mostly evaporated."
- "While the onions are cooling, prepare the sauce. Please use your favorite tomato sauce. Add the tomato sauce, white wine, water, soup stock cube, and bring to a boil after the stock cube has dissolved. Turn the heat off."
- "Add panko to a bowl, and sprinkle with the milk. Finely chop the bell pepper and parsley, and add to the bowl. Put the ground meat and egg at this point, and everything together well."
- "Add the cooled ingredients from Step 2 to Step 4, and mix again (The mixture in the photo doesn&#39;t include parsley, so it will actually be greener)."
- "Form the meatballs. Make a ball about the same size as the Brussels sprouts, place in the palm of your hand, and firmly press in a sprout (Refer to photo). The meat mixture is covering the sprout but there wasn&#39;t enough, so I added more, covering all exposed areas, and rolled into a ball."
- "Roll all of the balls the same way, as shown. Heat the pan with the sauce over medium heat."
- "In order to seal the flavor of the meat, brown the meatballs in a frying pan before adding to the sauce. Cook 4 at a time in a frying pan with a little oil, rolling them around until browned. Use a spoon to scoop them out, and put them into the pan with the sauce."
- "Transfer all of the meatballs into the pot. Bring the sauce to a boil and then reduce to a low heat, cover with a lid, and simmer gently for about an hour. Turn the meatballs over from time to time."
- "This is after an hour. Let it cool once if you have time, heat it up again - it will become even more delicious as the flavors penetrate the meatballs even more."
- "When you cut into them, the Brussels sprouts are nice and round. It is really soft, so it is easy to eat."
