- "Using your paddle attachment to work up to medium speed, beat butter with dry ingredients until butter has crumbled into smaller pieces and mixture is consistent.

- "Place onto parchment-lined cookie sheet, about one to two inches apart."
- "For 8 large scones, bake 15-17 min or until golden brown."
- "For 16 small scones, adjust baking time to 11-13 min or until golden brown."
