recipeinstructions:
- "Add the mushrooms, shallot, and garlic to a food processor. Pulse until no chunks remain and the mixture is mostly smooth, almost a puree."
- "Melt a knob of butter in a medium pan on medium-high heat. Add the mushroom mixture and sage, and fry for about 7 or 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the brandy and continue frying 1 minute until no liquid remains. Stir in the spinach. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked black pepper, and fry for 1 more minute until wilted.

Season with salt and pepper, then stuff about 2 tbsp of the mushroom mixture into each pocket. Transfer the chicken to a foil lined baking tray."
- "In a small bowl, mix the mayo with the garlic powder and a pinch of salt. Brush the mayo on top of the chicken. Try to coat the fillets evenly. Sprinkle the fillets with panko, then pop the tray into a preheated 400 F oven for 25 to 30 minutes. After that, broil for an additional 1 or 2 minutes to brown the crust. Serve hot."
