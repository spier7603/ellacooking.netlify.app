- "1-2 teaspoon honey depends on how sweet you want"

- "When fork tender, uncover, increase heat to medium once more. Add balsamic vinegar, honey and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir or toss gently to coat. Saute until balsamic vinegar has reduced and honey begins to caramelize forming a nice glaze on the Brussels sprouts. About 5 minutes more."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning as desired before serving. Enjoy!"
