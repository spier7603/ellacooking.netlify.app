recipeingredient:
- "450 g plums stoned and quartered"
- "100 g caster sugar you can use jam sugar but Im not entirely convinced its necessary"
- "1 lemon juiced"
- "1 Earl Grey tea bag"
- "250 ml water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make a pot of tea using the tea bag and water. Leave it to brew for at least 15 minutes - you need it to be undrinkably strong."
- "Place all the ingredients in a large pan and bring to a moderate boil."
- "Simmer gently for about half an hour. Observe the beautiful jewel-like colours developing in your pan."
- "Test the jam using Nigella&#39;s clever saucer method (test a teaspoonful on a cold saucer, place in fridge for 30 seconds, if the jam wrinkles when pushed by a finger the jam is set. If not repeat this process every 5 minutes until the jam wrinkles.)"
- "Remove from the heat, then carefully pour the jam into sterilised jars (4 or so should do it, and I normally run jam jars through the dishwasher before drying them in a low oven - do this while the jam is cooking, removing your jar just before you need it.)"
- "Seal, label and store. If your jam is reasonably well set you can leave it for quite some time - I have a jar a year old that&#39;s still good. Less well set jams should be stored in the fridge and eaten quickly."
