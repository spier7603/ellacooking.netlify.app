recipeinstructions:
- "Add flour baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Cube cold Butter and work into flour with fingertips. In mixer, or old-fashioned way, begin to slowly add milk carefully monitoring the dough until it comes into a ball like formation. Wrap and chill."
- "Wash all vegetables and prepare as seen below. You’ll be wanting to slice the brussels sprouts and cube the potatoes."
- "Add bacon to pan to render out the fat. Add in onions, garlic and green onions. Cook for a few minutes."
- "Add Brussel sprouts and assorted chilies, if you choose. Season generously with black pepper, salt and sazón. Allow them to cook down in the fat for a bit. They will soften and reduce in size. Add in a splash of white wine and cook off the alcohol."
- "Season the ground beef with the aforementioned spices. Add it to the party and cook it down. When browned, add in the cubed potatoes. Add about a 1/2 cup of water and simmer, covered, until potatoes are softened. The liquid will thicken. Allow to cool to room temperature."
- "Roll out pie dough and place in bottom of pan. Spoon in filling."
- "Prepare roux. Melt butter, add flour and stir constantly for roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Then add and cold milk. Continue to stir and add in about 50% of the cheese. You should have a consistency similar to this."
- "Pour roux over filling. Ideally, you’ll want to leave more of the bottom dough exposed so that you can get a tight seal with the top crust. I was greedy. I also forgot to add the cheese on top of the roux. Do that. Seal pie and make an air vent. Hit it with the egg wash."
- "Preheat oven to 425 F. Because I forgot to put the cheese inside of the pie I had to put it on top. I also struggled to seal it because I was being greedy with the filling. Amazingly... it didn’t matter. Bake 30 minutes or until crust is golden."
- "Allow to cool for about 20 minutes before cutting. If you’re going to purposefully make a mistake and put cheese on top... cover it with foil half way through so that it doesn’t burn."
