recipeinstructions:
- "Place flounder on a paper towel and salt on both sides. A few healthy pinches. Place another paper towel on top and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Pat the fillets gently to remove excess moisture then season with black pepper."
- "Mix all ingredients into a good size bowl aside from the 5-6 cups of oil and the flounder fillets. Add the milk slowly. You want a nice consistency. Not too thick and not too runny. You can’t take the milk out, so be careful adding it."

- "They also make for good fish sandwiches."
