- "1 small jar of blueberry preserves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Core the apples and arrange them in your smoker or grill for indirect heat, (foil rings help stabolize them if you have trouble with them rolling away.) if using a grill put soaked Apple wood chips in a foil pack with holes in it on the hot coals, Smoke for 20-30 minutes. (the apples should get soft on the grill but not overly soft, they still have to bake for 30 minutes.)"
- "In a bowl, mix brown sugar, butter, oats, flour, cinnimon, and nutmeg. Set aside."
- "Into a greased baking dish spread the blueberry preserves in an even layer.(this will use moisture from the apples and turn into a Blueberry sauce once baked)"

- "Put softened cream cheese into a piping bag and pipe over the top. Bake at 375° for 30 minutes."
- "Serve as is, or top with vanilla ice cream."
- "Afterthought: If your apples taste too smokey, peel them before baking. The peel holds a lot of the smoke flavor."
