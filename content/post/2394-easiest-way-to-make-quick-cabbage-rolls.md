recipeinstructions:

- "Add the garlic, tomato paste, Italian seasoning and paprika. Continue frying another 2 minutes."

Put the roll in the tray and repeat until all the leaves and meat are used. Spread the remaining sauce over the rolls. Cover the tray tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour. Serve immediately."
