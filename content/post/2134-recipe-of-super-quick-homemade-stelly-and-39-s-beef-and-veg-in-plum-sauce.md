recipeingredient:
- "450 g beef steak flank or sirloin sliced into thin strips"
- "4 tbsp soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp mirin"
- "1 tbsp toasted sesame oil"
- "2 tbsp cornstarch"
- "250 g button mushrooms quartered"
- "1 crown broccoli chopped"
- "1/2 jicama peeled and chopped into 1 cm pieces"
- "200 g chopped baby corn"
- "1 medium onion sliced thinly"
- "3 cloves garlic chopped"
- "2 tbsp oyster sauce"
- "1/4 cup plum sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, toss the beef with the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, cornstarch, a splash of veg oil (no more than 2 or 3 tbsp), and a few grinds of black pepper. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes to marinate and soften."
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for about 5 minutes until browned, then remove them to a bowl. Next, add the broccoli to the pan. Refresh the oil if necessary. Give the broccoli 1 or 2 minutes head-start, then add the jicama and baby corn. Fry another 2 minutes. Next, throw in the onion and garlic. Fry another 2 minutes until the onions turn translucent. Remove everything to the bowl with the mushrooms."
- "Add the beef, including the marinade, to the pan. If the sauce sticks or starts to burn, add a splash of cold water. This isn&#39;t a stir-fry, so don&#39;t worry if it looks a little wet. Let cook until the beef is no longer pink but not yet fully cooked. This should only take 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Return all the veg to the pan. Add the oyster and plum sauces, as well as 1/2 cup water, and toss to coat everything. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer for a minute or so, then serve immediately with plenty of freshly steamed rice."
