recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 220C. Sit out puff pastry to thaw."

- "Pulse-chop mushrooms in food processor so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. Make sure not to over mix so they don’t become slurry."
- "Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan, add thyme, and fry the mushrooms on medium heat for about 10 mins stirring often until softened"
- "Season the mushroom mixture, pour over wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred."

- "Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over."
- "Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go."
- "Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry."
- "Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet."
- "Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm."
- "Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry."
- "Beat the egg wash and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet."
- "Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides."
- "Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle."
- "Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry."
- "Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C"
- "Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp. 20-25 mins for medium-rare."
