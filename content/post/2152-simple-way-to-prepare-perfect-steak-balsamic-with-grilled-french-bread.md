recipeinstructions:
- "Prior to cooking let steaks come to room temperature. Season both sides with a seasoning of your choice. Grill the steaks to get a good sear and cook to your preferred doneness. We like our steaks medium rare so we take them off the grill when they reach 100F."
- "When steaks are done remove from grill and let rest. While the steaks are resting sauté vegetables (except tomatoes) in a pan with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Season with salt. Cover pan. When vegetables are just softened add the garlic and tomatoes and cook for 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat."
- "Mix balsamic vinegar, cracked pepper and Italian seasoning in a bowl. Slice the steaks and add to the vegetables along with any meat juices. Add the balsamic dressing and mix well."
- "Slice French bread and brush with oil. I prefer a seasoned olive oil like chili pepper or garlic. Place on grill (or use oven broiler) and slightly char. Remove and butter."
- "Plate the steak, vegetables and bread. Serve and enjoy."
