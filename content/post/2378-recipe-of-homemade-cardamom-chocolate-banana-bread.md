recipeingredient:
- "8 tbsp (113 g) unsalted butter softened"
- "2/3 cup (142 g) light brown sugar"
- "1 tsp Chinese Five Spice or 12 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 tsp ground cardamom"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp fine sea salt"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 1/2 cup (340 g) ripe bananas about 3 bananas"
- "1/4 cup (85 g) honey"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 1/4 cup (269 g) allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup (57 g) chopped walnuts optional"
- "1 banana cubed"
- "4 oz (110 g) semisweet chocolate roughly chopped"
- "3 tbsp sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 banana sliced longways"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 325°F (162°C). Lightly grease or line a 5” x 9” pan with parchment paper and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cardamom, Chinese Five Spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt on medium speed or until smooth."
- "Chop up your ripe bananas and add them to a food processor, along with the honey, and eggs. Blitz this mixture until smooth, then pour it into the large mixing bowl and mix until well combined."
- "Add in the flour and walnuts and beat just until smooth. Carefully stir chopped chocolate and banana cubes into the batter until incorporated. Transfer the batter to the pan."
- "Take 3 heaping tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk and swirl them into the batter. Slice up one banana long-ways and place it flat-side up on top of the batter."
- "Bake for 65 minutes. Check on the bread with 20 minutes left, if it’s browning too much, gently place a piece of aluminum foil over top. Remove the bread from the oven; a long toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean, with a few wet crumbs clinging to it. The toothpick shouldn&#39;t show any sign of uncooked batter. If it does, bake the bread an additional 5 minutes, or until it tests done."
- "Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove it from the pan and cool it completely on a rack."
