recipeingredient:
- "1 cup diced broccoli very small flourets"
- "1 1/2 cup of quartered brussel sprouts"
- "7 eggs"
- "1 small packet of diced pancetta or diced bacon"
- "1 diced onion"
- "1/3 stick butter preferably unsalted"
- "1 pinch black pepper"
- "1 1/2 pinch salt to season"
- "1/2 cup grated cheese I use parmesan or pecorino"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a frying pan add the quartered sprouts and cover with two cups of water. Simmer these for ten minutes before adding the broccoli and onion and the salt. Simmer for another ten minutes until broccoli and sprouts soften (add a bit more water if it boils off too quickly and the veg is still hard). The aim is for the water to have evaporated by the time the veg is ready."
- "Add pancetta and stir untill pancetta is cooked and all water has evaporated. Then add the butter. Heat untill butter starts to simmer."
- "In a bowl mix the eggs together with the black pepper."
- "Pour the egg mix into the pan and quickly mix everything together, combining the butter and all the veg, especially in the center of the pan. Once it starts thickening in the center, allow to rest on a low heat for the bottom and sides of the omelette to cook. Occaisionally roll the pan around above the heat to move the uncooked egg around nearer the edges."
- "The top of the omelette will still be soft, so once the sides are cooked remove from heat. Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the omelette and place pan under the grill for 2-5 minutes, keeping a careful eye on it to ensure it does not overcook (or melt your pan handles!)."
- "Serve immediately. Best served with a salad and sweetcorn. Enjoy!"
