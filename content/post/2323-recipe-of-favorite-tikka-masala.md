- " Chicken"
- "3-4 lbs Chicken Thighs"
- "1 Cup Plain Greek Yogurt"
- "1/2 of Spice Mix"
- "1/2 Tablespoon Olive Oil For Frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all Spice Mix ingredients in a small bowl and stir with a fork"
- "Poke holes in the skin of the chicken thighs with a fork to help with absorbing marinade. Put the thighs in a large bowl."
- "Add 1 Cup Yogurt and half of the spice mix to bowl with the chicken thighs, mix thoroughly. Cover and put in fridge for at least 30 minutes."
- "While chicken is in the fridge, finely chop a medium yellow onion, 5 cloves of garlic, and slice 4 whole stalks of scallion. Set aside."
- "After chicken has marinated as long as you want, heat a large, preferably wide bottomed pot over medium high heat. When it reaches temperature, add olive oil."
- "Shake off some but not all of the yogurt marinade from the chicken, and add to the pot. Save marinade in the bowl. Only do a few pieces at a time, as you want the chicken and spices to brown well. Flip once after 3 minutes, or until the bottom is browned. The chicken shouldn&#39;t be cooked through yet, it will finish cooking in the sauce. It&#39;s okay if the chicken sticks a bit, the spices will continue to toast, and you&#39;ll deglaze it later with the wine. Remove chicken to a cutting board."
- "Slice chicken into bite sized pieces, and return them to the marinade bowl, coating them all over again."
- "Add a little bit more olive oil to the pan, and throw in the onion and scallions. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Cook for 3-4 minutes stirring occasionally."
- "Add garlic and the other half of the spice mix, cook another minute. Add red wine and tomato paste. Scrape all the chicken and spices that stuck to the bottom of the pot up."
- "Add whole tomatoes to the pot, crush with potato masher or wooden spoon. Add crushed tomatoes. Rinse the remaining tomato juice stuck to the side of the can with water, and add about half a tomato can&#39;s worth of that liquid to the pot."
- "Bring the liquid to just boiling, and add the chicken pieces along with the 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. Reduce to medium or medium low, and simmer anywhere between 1-4 hours"
- "40 minutes before you want to serve, add the coconut milk. Right before serving, taste for seasoning, add salt, or other seasonings to your preference."
- "Serve with rice and naan"
