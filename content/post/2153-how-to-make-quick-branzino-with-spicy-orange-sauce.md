recipeingredient:
- "2 Branzino Fillets"
- " Sauce note you can make the sauce ahead of time"
- "3/4 cup fresh orange juice about 3 oranges"
- "1 Tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 large shallot minced for best results I like to use my small food processor to chop the shallot and garlic together in nice small pieces"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 tsp red pepper flakes"
- "1/2 tsp corn starch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the non skin side of the branzino with a seasoning of your choice. In a pan add a Tbsp of oil over medium to high heat. When pan is hot, add fish skin side up. Cook for 2 minutes to get a good sear on it. Turn fish over and finish cooking. Branzino is a thin fish and cooks quickly. Use high heat if you want a crispy skin to eat, but I find the skin just usually falls off. When fish is done remove to a plate."
- "Add another Tbsp of oil and a Tbsp of butter to the pan on low heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until soft, about 1 minute. Add orange juice, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and corn starch. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Stir occasionally and reduce sauce. Sauce does not really thicken much it is more about reducing the sauce to intensify the taste. Remove sauce to a serving cup."
- "Plate fish and pour sauce over. Provide extra sauce on the side. Serve and enjoy. I like my fish with grilled vegetables and a baked potato. Or with my mashed potatoes and corn on the cob."
