recipeingredient:
- "1 lb Ground Turkey"
- "6 Large Cabbage Leaves"
- "1 Large Carrot diced"
- "2 Celery Stalks diced"
- "1 Yellow Onion diced"
- "4 Cloves Garlic minced"
- "3 oz Tomato Paste"
- "1 (14.5 oz) can Petite Diced Tomatoes"
- "1 tsp Paprika"
- "1 tsp Garam Masala"
- "1-2 sprigs Fresh Thyme"
- "to taste Salt and Pepper"
- "1/4 tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flake optional"
- " Extra Virgin Olive Oil for browning meat and sauteing vegetables"
- " Preheat Oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit"
recipeinstructions:
- "Have all your ingredients prepped and ready to go. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add a little oil and your turkey meat to start browning. Once your turkey is done add in about a 3rd of the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Season with a little salt &amp; pepper. Stir, turn down to medium low, and cover. Let this cook for about 10 minutes (until the the veggies are nice and tender.)"
- "Once your vegetables are soft. Add your paprika and garam masala. If you don&#39;t have garam masala you could just leave it out or substitute a little cumin instead. Use a little water or broth to help scrape up all the brown bits in the pan as you stir your meat mixture. Mix well &amp; remove meat from pan and set aside. Using the same pan, give a quick wipe with a towel and add a little more oil and the rest of your diced vegetables and garlic. Add salt &amp; pepper to taste &amp; saute over medium heat."
- "Once your veggies are soft add the tomato pastes and stir well. Let this cook for just a couple of minutes as you stir and then add you can tomatoes. You could use crushed tomatoes or a sauce but I like the chunky texture. Add you thyme and red pepper. Stir and let cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes. You can add a little extra liquid if the sauce is too thick for your liking. Remove from heat and set aside."
- "Next prepare your cabbage leaves. In a large pot bring enough water to cover all the leave to a full boil. Salt the water (a good pinch will do.) Submerge the leaves into the boiling water and cook for just a few minutes. You just want them to be pliable so you can roll them easily. And as you can see they turn a bright green. Drain and then trim any thick stem from the leaves."
- "Now you&#39;re ready to roll. Spoon in some sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Fill each leaf with about 1/3 cup of your meat mixture. Roll each leaf tightly and place seam side down in the baking dish."
- "Once all your leaves are roll and placed seam side down, pour remaining sauce all over them. Cover tightly with foil and place in your preheated oven. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 30 minutes or until cabbage is tender."
- "Serve as is or over rice. I chose to keep it low carb and just ate it as is."
