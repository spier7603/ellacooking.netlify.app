- "Add the cardamom powder to it. Mix it properly and keep it aside.Steps for Gujiya Dough:- 1. Take the All purpose flour and add 5Tbsp ghee to it. For the soft Gujiyas, you need to add more ghee. Rub the ghee properly with the flour and try to bind it together. If it can take the shape then this is perfect. Now add the water slowly to it and make a hard dough. It won’t be smooth. Cracks will be there. Try to make dough together. Then cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15mins."
- "Step for sugar syrup:-  1. Add the sugar and water together to a pan on a high heat and continuously stir it till the sugar completely dissolves.Then leave it unattended till a boil comes. Switch it to medium flame, mix it and let it cooked for 7mins more or till you get the consistency where if you will check between your fingers then it’s slightly sticky like honey. Now switch off the flame and keep the syrup aside."
- "Steps for making and deep frying Gujiyas:- 1. First take small balls of the dough and roll it into a thin circle like chapatis and cut it with a cap or any cutter of the desired shape. The center should be little thick and the edges should be thin. Then fill the gajar halwa stuffing in the center And apply water on the edges so that the Gujiyas will be properly sealed and will not break in the oil."
- "Use gujiya maker or your hand to gently fold and seal the Gujiyas. Carefully, bring together both the edges and join. Gently press the edges. Cover the prepared Gujiyas with a damp cloth so that it won’t get dried. 2. In the mean time, put a pan with ghee in medium heat and wait till oil becomes slightly hot. Oil should not be too hot else the Gujiyas will be hard from outside and remains uncooked from inside. Then fry the Gujiyas in medium heat which will take 12 to 15mins to fry both the sides"
- "Once both the sides of the Gujiyas turn golden yellow, those are ready to be dipped in the sugar syrup. Sugar syrup should be slight warm then only the Gujiyas will absorb the syrup. Keep each gujiya dip in the syrup for 40seconds to make it juicy from inside out. Then strain the Gujiyas on the kitchen towel. Repeat the process for all the Gujiyas and then you can sprinkle some crushed dry fruits of your choice on the top of the Gujiyas and serve it."
