recipeingredient:
- " Unsalted butter"
- "1 shallot finely chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic finely chopped"
- "1/3 cup pure apple juice"
- "2 tbsp apple cider vinegar"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "3 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon dill and Italian parsley"
- "2 centrecut fillet salmon deboned and skinon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt 2 tbsp butter in a small pot over medium-low heat, and add the shallot and garlic. Sweat them slowly for 2 or 3 minutes until they&#39;re soft but not browned. Add the apple juice and cider vinegar, and let simmer until only about 2 tbsp liquid remains."
- "Whisk 4 tbsp cold butter into the pot, one tbsp at a time. The sauce should thicken slightly as it emulsifies. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked black pepper."
- "Turn the heat down to low and whisk in the heavy cream. Allow the sauce to warm up for 1 or 2 minutes, careful not to let it boil. For better presentation, strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve. If you don&#39;t mind it rustic or simply run out of time (as I obviously did, from the picture), you can skip this step. Add the fresh herbs, adjust the seasoning, then turn the heat down to minimum as you cook the salmon."
- "Add a knob of butter and small splash of olive oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper, and fry them for 4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Remove the fillets to a plate and carefully peel off the skins. Serve the salmon with a generous drizzle of the sauce."
