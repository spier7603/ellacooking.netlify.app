recipeingredient:
- "3 Pomegranates"
- "1 large White rum"
- "100 grams Crystal rock sugar"
- "2 Lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the seeds of the pomegranate carefully without crushing them. Rinse them while picking away anything that&#39;s not a seed and dry well."
- "Peel the lemons and cut into 2-4 equal pieces. (This time I steeped everything in a bottle with quite a narrow neck so cut the lemons into eighths.)"
- "Add the pomegranate seeds and the lemon to a bottle and then sprinkle the crystal rock sugar over the top. Finally pour in the white rum. This time I used an empty bottle that used to be filled with dark rum so I didn&#39;t have to sterilize it. However, make sure you usually sterilize the container that you&#39;re going to steep everything in, either with alcohol or boiling water. Remove the fruit after 2-3 months."
- "I took a photo after 3 weeks had passed (4th Nov.). It&#39;s become such a cute pink colour, though in time the red colour will probably fade."
- "I took the fruit out in Feb. 2007 and am leaving it to mature. The flavour doesn&#39;t really stand out so much but it has a gentle tartness to it. This alcohol isn&#39;t so sweet so you can look forward to drinking it straight. The colour has faded from a pink to a light brown here. Updated 1.6.2007."
