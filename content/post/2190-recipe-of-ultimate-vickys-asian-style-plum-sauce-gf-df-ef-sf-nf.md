- "4 clove garlic finely chopped"
- "1/2 oz fresh ginger weighed then grated"
- "1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes"
- "480 ml (2 cups) water"
- "30 ml (1/8 cup) soy sauce see my link below for my recipe"
- "30 ml teriyaki sauce see below for my freefrom recipe"
- "1 juice of 1 whole lemon"
- "1 tsp sesame oil or oil of choice"
- "1 tbsp cornflour cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all of the ingredients apart from the cornstarch slurry into a large pan. Bring to the boil then turn down to a simmer for 30 minutes  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332952-vickys-soy-sauce-substitute https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/349993-vickys-baked-teriyaki-chicken-gf-df-ef-sf-nf"
- "Meanwhile you&#39;ll need to sterilise some jars. To do so wash them in hot soapy water, rinse well then put them in the oven at gas 1 / 140C / 275°F until your sauce is done. This recipe makes enough to fill around 4 x 454g (1 pound) jars"
- "Put the contents of the pan through a blender and puree smooth. Take out a spoonful and let cool a little then taste to see at this point if you need to adjust the flavour to taste. Don&#39;t be scared with the chilli flakes - the sauce will be a bit hot freshly made but will mellow as it sits"
- "Return to the pan, mix in the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 3 minutes until thickened and the starch taste is cooked out"
- "Pour into the hot, sterilised jars (fill just 5mm from the top) and seal. Put the jars on a wire rack to cool then store in a dark place"
- "The colour of the finished sauce will depend on the variety of plums you use"
- "Serve as a dipping sauce or accompaniement to duck, chicken, pork, spring rolls etc"
