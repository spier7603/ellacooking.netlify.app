recipeinstructions:
- "Pick through beans to remove and small rocks, debris and broken beans. I place on a large platter in small batches and move picked through beans to one side."
- "Wash and drain cleaned beans."
- "I use a quick cook method to start. Place beans in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn off heat, cover and let rest one hour."
- "Now rinse beans and add to a large stock pot or dutch oven. I use a ceramic coated cast iron. I like the heat retention of this cooking vessel."
- "Cover beans with fresh warm water. Water level should be about 4 inches over beans."
- "Add crushed garlic. Cut green pepper in half, deseed and remove top. Add in too."
- "Remove skin off of onion, cut in half add this along with ham hock and tied up cilantro, bay leaf."
- "Lastly add in cumin."
- "Bring pot to a low boil on medium-high heat. Reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 11/2 hours."
- "Add in salt and lime after 11/2 hours. Adding salt in the  beginning results in a tougher bean. Simmer another 15 minutes until beans reach a tender state."
- "Remove garlic, onion, pepper, lime and cilantro. Discard."
- "Remove hamhock and remove meat from bone. Cut into small dice and set aside."
- "Drain liquid from beans. You may reserve this if you wish to make black bean soup."
- "Add ham bits into beans if you wish."
- "Serve beans over rice and most Cubans will suggest finely diced fresh red onion on top!"
- "You may freeze portions to reserve for later use. I do since this is a longer process. Just thaw and heat."
- "Recipe by taylor68too."
- "To make this a vegetarian version, omit the hamhock. You lose some flavor but it will still be good."
