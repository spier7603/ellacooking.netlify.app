- "Now the BANANAS. You can add them now, and use the lemon juice method so they don&#39;t turn brown, OR you can add them fresh into the salad, and mix in once you&#39;re ready to serve. I also add some more crushed graham crackers sprinkled on top, and any leftover fruits just to decorate."
- "You can also use this as a dip, and just dunk in with some graham crackers. If you don&#39;t want to put them inside the salad. But it tastes sooooo much better mixed in. But also is just as good double dunked with graham crackers.üåù"
