recipeingredient:
- "8 Brussels sprouts"
- "20 grams Butter"
- "1 clove Garlic"
recipeinstructions:
- "Halve both the Brussels sprouts and garlic lengthwise."
- "In a small frying pan, heat butter and garlic on low heat with the cut-side of the garlic facing down. When the butter melts and the garlic becomes fragrant, add the Brussels sprouts, also cut-side down. Cover with a lid and steam cook on medium heat."
- "After 2 minutes, remove the lid, turn over the brussels sprouts, reduce to low heat, cover again, and roast for 3 more minutes. After they are done cooking, season with salt and pepper, briskly sauté, then serve."
- "Regarding the strength of the heat Brussels sprouts are easy to burn. In our home, we use an induction heating range. I gave the heat strengths as reference, but keep your eye on the pan and adjust the heat accordingly. A nice, crisp brown is good, but make sure it doesn&#39;t burn."
