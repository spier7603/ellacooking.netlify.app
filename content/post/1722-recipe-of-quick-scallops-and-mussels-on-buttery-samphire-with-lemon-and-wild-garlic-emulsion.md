recipeingredient:
- "100 g samphire"
- "200 g mussels"
- "8 large scallops"
- "1/2 shallot finely chopped"
- "40 g butter"
- " Juice of half lemon"
- "1/2 glass white wine  optional"
- " Salt  optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Steam your mussels by adding them to a saucepan. On a medium heat and cover with the lid. This will take only few minutes and the mussels will be ready when they are all open. Use supermarket ones for ease, but if using Fishmonger’s make sure they are clean of the ‘beard’."
- "In a frying pan prepare your samphire by adding the butter, the shallot and wait for it to sizzle and become translucent. Add your vegetable and toss in butter, add the lemon juice and let steam off. Set aside to assemble."
- "In the same frying pan sear your scallops. Depending on size I’d say it take 1-2 min per side. Always look for a gorgeous caramelisation and rest on a paper towel."
- "To assemble: in a bowl start by placing your samphire, then alternate your scallops and mussels. Add more lemon juice if preferred, I decorated with wild garlic flours and some micro greens from the garden."
