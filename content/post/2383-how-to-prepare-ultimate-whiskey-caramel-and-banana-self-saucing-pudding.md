- "4 tbsp golden syrup"
- "250 ml just boiled water"

recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oven to 180C fan on. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, almond slices or chopped pecans (if using) and a pinch of salt."
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mashed bananas, milk, butter, egg, cinnamon, vanilla, whiskey, nutmeg and sea salt until well combined. Gradually whisk the liquid and the flour mix together to make a batter."

- "Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until the pudding springs back when lightly pressed by a spoon. You will have a golden cooked sponge on top with a hot caramel sauce hidden beneath. Serve hot with ice cream, enjoy!"
