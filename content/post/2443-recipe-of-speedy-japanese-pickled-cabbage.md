- " Salted Konbu Seaweed"
- " Dashi Dry Variety"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate cabbage leaves, cut, wash and place in strainer. While the cabbage is in the strainer, salt the cabbage. (I personally like it a little salty). So, just take out the old Morton’s salt and give a nice shake for a 1 1/2 second count. Mix the cabbage up and repeat that one more time. Massage the cabbage a little bit to jumpstart the cabbage."
- "Now that the salt has softened (and flavored) the cabbage and released some moisture, transfer it to a bowl. Throw in three healthy lunches of seaweed, don’t be nervous. Two big bunches of dashi and as much pepper flake as you like. That part is optional. Incorporate it well and put it in a jar. I like to press it in using a meat tenderizer and then top it off. You can always get another jar too."
- "You’ll want to put it in the fridge for at least six hours. The salt will be extracting water so periodically flip the jar so everything stays moist. You’ll end up with this. Good luck."
