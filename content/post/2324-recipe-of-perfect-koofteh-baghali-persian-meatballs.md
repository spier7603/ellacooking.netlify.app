Remove from cooker and set aside to cool.  In a shallow bowl, add chicken, onion, turmeric, salt, pepper, savory, coriander, parsley, green onion and mint."
- "You should have about 1/2 cup worth of chopped fresh herbs.*  Mix to combine well.  *Ensure that the rice mixture is the same ratio as the chicken mixture.  If you have excess rice mixture, remove and set aside.  If the rice mixture ratio is more than the chicken mixture, the meatballs will be very tough.*"

- "If the stock is too much, simmer further before adding the meatballs.  If the stock is too little, add in more vegetable stock.  Bring the stew up to a simmer again.  Turn the heat down to low."
- "Cover and cook for about 30 mins.  *Do not open the cover. This is to prevent evaporation.*  After 30 mins, add in potatoes, tomatoes and plums.  Add in more vegetable stock until it is 3/4 height of the meatballs."
- "Cover and cook for another 25 mins or until the potatoes are fork tender.  Add in fresh mint.  Taste and adjust for final seasoning with salt and pepper.  Give it a final stir."
- "Remove from heat.  Transfer onto serving plate.  Serve immediately with more fresh mint and a hard boiled egg."
- "To make hard boiled eggs, in a sauce pot, add eggs.  Fill the pot with water.  Put in 1 finger on top of 1 egg, the water should fill up to your 1st knuckle.  Bring the water up to a boil."
- "Let the water boil for 1 min.  Cover the pot for 15 mins.  Spoon out the eggs into a bowl of cold water.  Lightly crack the eggs and let it sit in the water so that the egg shells could be easily peeled off.*"
