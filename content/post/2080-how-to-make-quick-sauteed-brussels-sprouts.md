recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 lb fresh Brussels Sprouts"
- "1 1/2 tbsp butter"
- "1/2 tbsp olive oil"
- "3/4 tsp garlic salt"
- "3/4 tsp Mrs Dash Original Seasoning saltfree"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse Brussels Sprouts."
- "Cut off the ends, slice sprouts in half and remove outer layer of leaves."
- "Melt butter and olive oil over medium high heat in a large non-stick frying pan."
- "Add sprouts, garlic salt and Mrs. Dash. Stir to coat."
- "Add 1 tablespoon of water to the frying pan and quickly place lid on pan. Let steam for about a minute then stir sprouts. Continue intervals of covering pan and stirring frequently until sprouts are tender (about 15 minutes). You don&#39;t want very much liquid in the pan; this way the sprouts will brown a little.

You can just saute them without covering but turn the heat down slightly and cook longer."
