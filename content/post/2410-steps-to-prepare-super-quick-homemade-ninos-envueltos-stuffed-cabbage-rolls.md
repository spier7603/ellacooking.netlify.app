- "In a large pan add some of the sauce to the bottom to keep cabbage rolls from burning. Gently add the rolls around the pot adding sauce as you layer them up. Once you have added all of your rolls in the pan, add some water üíß to help cook them. Turn heat to medium and let it slowly cook. Remember to taste your sauce in case you need to adjust the flavor."
- "The cooking of these will take about 20 to 25 minutes because you are really just cooking the meat at this point and making the sauce richer. Once you are happy with your cabbage rolls they are good to eat."
