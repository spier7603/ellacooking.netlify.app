recipeinstructions:
- "Take two leaves of a green cabbage. Chop into thin slices."

- "Stir fry the cabbage for a minute. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then salt and add white pepper to your taste. Stir fry for a couple of minute or to your liking."
- "Push the cabbage to the edges of your pan, in a circle shape, like a nest."
- "Cook the egg in the middle of the cabbage nest as you like. I scramble mine and pour it in; you can crack yours straight in. Season your egg as you like, or with black pepper and a little salt."
