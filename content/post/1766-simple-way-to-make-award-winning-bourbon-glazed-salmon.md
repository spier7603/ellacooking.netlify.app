recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup bourbon"
- "2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup"
- "2 tablespoons brown sugar"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 tablespoon soy sauce"
- "1 clove minced garlic"
- "1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar"
- "2 pounds salmon"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Position racks in the center and upper third of your oven. Remove salmon from refrigerator and allow to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes while oven preheats and glaze cools."
- "In a medium saucepan, combine the bourbon, honey, brown sugar,Worcestershire, soy sauce, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. Bring mixture to a boil over medium high. Simmer rapidly, stirring almost constantly, until mixture has thickened and reduced by half, takes about 5 minutes. Remove pan heat."
- "Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. This will help clean up if glaze spills over. Lay large piece of foil over the parchment paper.(enough to be able to enclose the salmon)"
- "Lay salmon(skin side down) on top of foil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and rub into flesh. Brush all the glaze on top of salmon."
- "Fold the sides of the foil up and roll down loosely to completely enclose the salmon into a packet and allow air to circulate."
- "Bake 15 -18 minutes until almost cooked thru (still a bit pink). Remove pan from oven and roll back foil to expose salmon."
- "Change oven setting to broil and place pan under broiler on upper third of oven. Broil 3-4 minutes. Watch as fish can quickly go from perfect to overcooked. Fish is cooked at 145 degrees. Pull it a few degrees sooner and allow it to rest with foil over it to finish cooking. You don&#39;t want to let it sit very long as it will continue to cook and become overdone and dry."
