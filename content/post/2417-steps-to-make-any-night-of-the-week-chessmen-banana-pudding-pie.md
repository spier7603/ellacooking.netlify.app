recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400 F. Pulverize roughly half the box of vanilla wafers in a food processor along with melted butter. Place in 9x13 (I think that was the size) baking pan. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to gently but firmly pack it evenly. Bake until golden. 12-15 minutes."

- "Begin to layer the pie. Starting with pudding on the bottom."
- "The very top should end with whipped cream. Strategically place Chessmen cookies and vanilla wafers. Chill for a few hours before serving."
- "Of course, the second attempt was even more successful. They even had seasonal prints on them which were good for Easter Sunday, opposed to the signature chess piece characters."
