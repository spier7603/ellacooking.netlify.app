recipeingredient:
- " Seeds from freshly carved pumpkin"
- "1/2 tsp Pink Salt"
- "1 tsp Tony Cacheres"
- "1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper"
- "1 tsp Garlic Powder"
- "Pinch Paprika"
- "1 Tbs Vegetable Oil"
- "1 tsp Worcestershire"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Separate as many of the seeds from the pulp as you can and rinse them in a colander under cold water. Shake the seed as dry as possible, but do not pat dry them with paper towels as this may cause the seeds to stick."
- "Spray a baking sheet with nonstick baking spray. Spread the seeds in a single layer on the baking sheet and roast for approximately 30 minutes in order to dry them out."
- "In a mixing bowl, toss the seeds with vegetable oil (may substitute olive oil or melted butter), pink salt (my preference, sea salt or plain salt will suffice), Tony Cachere&#39;s, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika and worcestershire sauce. Place back onto backing sheet and return the seeds to the oven and bake until crisp and golden, approximately 20 more minutes."
- "Remove the seeds from the oven and allow to cool, as they should become more crisp as they begin to cool off."
