recipeinstructions:
- "Remove any dirt from the black beans and soak them in a bowl of water (not listed) overnight."

- "Once the cooking time is done and the beans are tender, adjust the taste with salt and pepper. Lightly salt at this point since the soup may get saltier by simmering a little longer. Simmer for another 45 minutes."
- "Adjust the taste again, lightly stir in the chopped cilantro at the end and it is done!"
- "These are called &#34;large black beans&#34; in Japan instead of the regular black beans (black soy beans). (They are closer to the beans used to make Chinese fermented black beans.)"
