recipeingredient:
- "1 to 1 12 kg Ume plums"
- "1 bottle  White liquor or clear alcohol 35 alcohol"
- "700 grams Rock sugar crystals"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the ume plums in water and drain into a colander. Pat dry each well with a dry cloth. Using a bamboo skewer, pry out the stems of each plum. Nankou-bai variety plums have thin skins and little bitterness, so don&#39;t soak them in water. For other varieties of ume plums, soak in water for about an hour before use!"
- "Wash the glass jar with water, and wipe dry. Put in the ume plums and rock sugar crystals in alternating layers. Pour in the white liquor, and keep in a cool dark place."
- "It will be ready in a year. By letting it mature for a year, the ume plum essence will be completely extracted, making the liqueur have a rich, umami-filled and well balanced flavor."
- "For long-term storage: You can keep the plums in the alcohol for 1-2 years, but if you plan to store for longer, take them out! Otherwise the liqueur will lose its fragrance and may become cloudy."
- "Q. How to choose the right preserving jar? A. 4 liter jar: use 1 to 1.2 g of ume plums. 6 liter jar: 1.5 kg of ume plums. 8 liter jar: 2 kg of ume plums (which is double the amount in this recipe)."
- "Q. Why don&#39;t you poke holes into the ume. A. For best results, don&#39;t make holes in the plums! Otherwise, the essence of the plums will be absorbed back into them, via holes or cuts."
- "A. How to make the ume plums in the liqueur stay round?  A. If you want round, plump alcohol-infused ume plums, consider the opposite of the advice I wrote in Step 6, and make holes in the plums so that they absorb back the ume essence. However, the liqueur won&#39;t be the best."
